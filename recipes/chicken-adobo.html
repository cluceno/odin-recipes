        <h4>Ingredients</h4> 
            <ul>
                <li>White vinegar</li>
                <li>Soy sauce</li>
                <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
                <li>Black peppercorns</li>
                <li>Bay leaves</li>
                <li>Brown sugar</li>
                <li>Chicken thighs</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Aside from the chicken thighs, mix all ingredients together to create the marinade</li>
                <li>Marinate the chicken thighs in the adobo sauce for at least an hour. To absorb the most flavor, you can marinate the chicken for as long as 3 hours. If you marinade the chicken too long, the texture of the chicken will be affected.</li>
                <li>Fry the chicken thighs until they are browned. They don't need to be cooked through, but try and focus on getting a nice golden-brown color and crispy texture.</li>
                <li>Once the chicken is browned and crispy, pour in the marinade and bring the chicken and sauce to a boil. Simmer until the sauce has reduced by half and the chicken is completely cooked through.</li>
            </ol>
